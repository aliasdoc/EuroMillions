[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kingarthurpt/EuroMillions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kingarthurpt/EuroMillions)

## What is this repository?
This is a personal project where I try to predict the next Euro Millions winning numbers.
I'm confident that this application will work someday.

*This is like a bomb, it only has to work once.*

## Live demo
The project is hosted at [Openshift](http://milhoes-kingarthurpt.rhcloud.com/) and will be receiving any commit to *master branch*.

## Upcoming features
- Euro Millions statistics and probabilities;
- Abstraction to adapt to other types of draws;
- Public REST API;
