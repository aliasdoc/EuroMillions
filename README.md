## Introduction
This is a personal project where I try to predict the next Euro Millions winning numbers.
I'm confident that this application will work someday.

*This only needs to work once, like a bomb...*

## Live demo
The project is hosted at [Openshift](http://milhoes-kingarthurpt.rhcloud.com/) and will be receiving any commit to *master branch*.

## Implemented features
- A crawler to feed the database with the latest draw results;

## Upcoming features

- Abstraction to adapt to other types of draws;
- Public REST API;
